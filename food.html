                <p><strong>Shawarma</strong> is one of my favorite foods. It features a pita bread that includes meat and vegetables. The dish originated from middle east and is a very popular dish throughout the world.</p>
                <p>Shawarma is prepared from thin cuts of seasoned and marinated lamb, mutton, veal, beef, chicken, or turkey. The slices are stacked on a skewer about 60 cm (20 in) high. Pieces of fat may be added to the stack to provide extra juiciness and flavor. A motorized spit slowly turns the stack of meat in front of an electric or gas-fired heating element, continuously roasting the outer layer. Shavings are cut off the rotating stack for serving, customarily with a long flat knife.</p>

              <p><strong>Caldereta</strong> is another dish that I love, in which my grandpa always cooks for it at home, during special occasions. The dish is mostly loved by filipinos, as it can be made in a lot of ways with many different ingredients.</p>
              <p>Calderata, which comes from the word caldera, meaning cauldron, is another example of the many Spanish influences in Filipino cuisine. While similar to afritada and mechado in preparation and use of tomatoes, potatoes, carrots, and bell peppers, this hearty beef stew also includes liver spread and shredded cheese to thicken the sauce and chili peppers to add spice.</p>
